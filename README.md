# Unity-Demos
It was a long road to choose the right engine.
Raw opengl with wrappers for different modules and
main loop, SDL, Box2d and Assimp libraries, Wildmagic engine,
canvas environments of js libraries and qt framework,
various specific engines for quests, arcades and so on -
what a marvelous time it was.

But the fast cs evolution places its rules. So,
choosing between Unreal Engine, CryEngine or Unity
was a must, and a couple for specific tasks. Blueprints
are nice, but that is a matter of personal preference,
Cpp was pretty bored with me, so convenient solution
of Unity was a good choice at that time.

Oblivion gates to 3d modelling, texturing, skinning, rigging
and animations, raster and vector 2d graphics, scripting of gui, 
physics and mechanics, juggling with shaders and particle systems,
animators and controllers, ai algorithms, databases and editor expansions
opened where they could and where couldn't.

Uniting solid working modules into something that seems
rigid is cool, although debugging doesn't seem so,
but what can wa do. ðŸ˜…
